# Job Application Dashboard

## Application Overview

### Application Description

Job Application Dashboard was created to help people stay organized during the job application process.  The application addresses five elements of the job search and the application consists of six sections:

1. Jobs

The Jobs section of the application is where information pertaining to a job posting is stored.  Here, users can record information that is found on the average job posting, including the job description, job requirements, and application deadlines (among others).

2. Reminders

The reminders category is where a user can keep to-do lists for different job applications.  Each reminder can be listed as an "action", where a user needs to complete a task, and "pending", where a user can monitor waiting for a response from an employer.

3. Contacts

Contacts is where personal information is stored for an employer representative.  Phone numbers and emails are two pieces of data that can be stored.

4. Communications

The communications section can be used to include notes about an interview or a discussion with an potential employer.  It can also be used to store emails and other correspondences regarding a job posting.

5. Documents

A user can monitor which resume and cover letter were sent to a specific company.

6. Dashboard

The dashboard can be thought of as the welcome page on each login.  It represents a summary of information and highlights upcoming and overdue reminders.  It also lists recently created job records for jobs, documents, contacts, and communications.

### Key Application Features

1. Linking Records to a Job Application

The primary benefit of using this app is that information stored in any category (i.e. reminders, contacts, communications, and documents) can be linked to a specific job application.  When viewing a stored job posting, all linked items can be found on a single page, which makes referencing information fast and easy.

2. Application Priority

An additional feature enables users to rank the importance of a specific job application.  This is beneficial when there are multiple applications that need to be completed and a user needs to prioritize.  In the Jobs section of the app, incomplete applications are sorted by priority.

## Application Approach & Design

When designing the application, user stories and wireframes were created to ensure that the app would best fit the needs of school counselors.

### User-Stories
The following is a sample of user stories that were considered in the production of the application.

1. As a user, I would like to store all relevant job application materials and information
2. As a user, I would like records to a specific job application
3. As a user, I would like to have all records and information relevant to a specific job application found in one place.
4. As a user, I would like to be able to prioritize job applications through a ranking system.
5. As a user, I would like to easily create, update, and view all records.

### Wireframes

### Application Limitations & Unresolved Issues

The primary limitation of this application is the inability to sort a and search tables.  Given time contraints, search methods were not implemented and only some tables are filtered and sorted.
